/**
 * Voice connection presentation state — and ONLY presentation state.
 *
 * Per AR12 / ADR-007 / Architecture Pattern 7, voice is an independent
 * subsystem that never blocks game state. This store is the SOLE home for
 * voice connection status: `connectVoice` writes here and nowhere else, and no
 * game reducer/handler may read it. It must never carry anything
 * game-authoritative (no session, no bomb, no phase) — that lives in
 * `gameStore`, which voice may read for role/team but never write.
 *
 * Status machine: idle → connecting → connected, with any failure (token
 * error, connect rejection, timeout, transport drop) resolving to
 * `unavailable`. `unavailable` surfaces as dismissible microcopy only — the
 * game keeps running (AC #3/#4).
